\section{Summary}
We have introduced the variational R{\'e}nyi bound and an associated optimisation framework. We have shown the richness of the new family, not only by connecting to existing approaches including VI/VB, SEP, BB-$\alpha$, VAE and IWAE, but also by proposing the VR-max algorithm as a new special case. Empirical results on Bayesian neural networks and variational auto-encoders indicate that VR bound methods are widely applicable and can obtain state-of-the-art results.

Future work will focus on both experimental and theoretical aspects. Theoretical work will study the interaction of the biases introduced by MC approximation and datapoint sub-sampling. Also a quantitative analysis of the MC approximation bias will be very useful, especially for model selection.
