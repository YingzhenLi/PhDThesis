To kickstart the discussion of variational methods unification, I provide a condensed introduction to two classes of well-known approximate inference techniques. I will first start by discussing statistical divergence measures since both of them are closely related to divergence minimisation. Then I will review the two methods in detail. Finally, I will touch on two main learning tasks in Bayesian deep learning as the primary applications of the approaches developed in this thesis.
